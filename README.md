## Introduction

The project focuses on developing a bidirectional translation model for the Santali language, working with English and Hindi. Santali, being one of the tribal languages, has limited digital resources available, which poses a risk of cultural diminishment in the digital age. This initiative aims to bridge the gap by creating robust translation tools to support the preservation and wider use of Santali. The project aligns with governmental efforts like the Bhashini project, which seeks to enhance the digital accessibility of India's tribal languages. Through this independent study, the potential of natural language processing (NLP) is harnessed to tackle significant challenges associated with low-resource languages, facilitating their enduring presence in modern digital communication channels.

## Literature Review

The literature review for this project highlighted several key publications and findings relevant to the development of translation models for low-resource languages:

1. **Transformer Models:** The introduction of the Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) revolutionized NLP by eliminating the need for recurrent layers, utilizing self-attention mechanisms to process text in parallel and significantly speeding up the training process.

2. **Handling of Rare Words:** Research on handling rare words through subword tokenization techniques like Byte Pair Encoding (Sennrich et al., 2016) was particularly relevant, as these techniques help improve the translation of low-frequency words, which are common in languages like Santali.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:** The use of BLEU scores for evaluating translation models was critiqued for its limitations in capturing the linguistic nuances of translations. This led to an exploration of alternative metrics such as chrF and COMET, which provide more nuanced assessments of translation quality.

These insights form the backbone of the approach to developing the Santali translation model, incorporating both theoretical advancements and practical considerations to address the unique challenges of translating low-resource languages.

## Methodology and Approach

The project adopted a comprehensive methodology focusing on developing robust translation models using the Fairseq framework, a popular choice for sequence-to-sequence tasks:

1. **Initial Code Review and Error Correction:**
   - Began with a Jupyter notebook provided by the instructors, walking through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation stages.
   - Debugged issues related to `unk_token` handling and fixed deprecated library functions for compatibility with the latest versions.

2. **Model Development Trials:**
   - Conducted initial experiments with English-Hindi and English-Manipuri models to understand the impact of various hyperparameters and model architectures on translation quality.
   - Utilized the Fairseq framework for training, applying different settings to optimize performance.

3. **Participation in Summer School:**
   - Attended a specialized Summer School program focused on machine translation for low-resource languages, with specific projects involving Tulu and Kannada.
   - Participated in intensive workshops that covered a range of topics from initial code debugging to advanced transliteration techniques. These sessions provided hands-on experience with other low-resource languages, which paralleled many of the challenges faced with Santali.
   - Engaged in collaborative projects that allowed for practical application of learned theories in natural language processing and translation models. This direct engagement helped refine the project’s approach to dealing with Santali, particularly in adapting models to handle complex transliterations and rare linguistic features.
   - Gained insights into innovative data augmentation techniques and cross-lingual training strategies that were later applied to enhance the Santali translation models, ensuring more robust handling of the language's unique characteristics.

4. **Transliteration and Named Entity Recognition:**
   - Implemented a focused transliteration task for named entities, utilizing tools like GIZA++ for word alignment and Stanza for named entity recognition (NER). This task was crucial for improving the accuracy of translations involving proper names and culturally significant terms, which are often poorly handled by general translation models.
   - Developed customized scripts and methodologies for extracting and aligning named entities from parallel corpora, which significantly improved the quality and cultural relevance of the translated texts.

## Conclusion

The development of translation models for Santali-English/Hindi presented several challenges, from dataset preparation to model fine-tuning and deployment. Through a structured approach, we progressively improved the models by incorporating additional data, refining preprocessing techniques, and leveraging transliteration tools for accurate handling of named entities. Each phase, including initial model development, iterative fine-tuning, and debugging, contributed to enhanced performance, as demonstrated by the improvements in BLEU scores across translation directions. Setting up and utilizing the ADA platform provided essential computational resources, although it required overcoming technical hurdles related to dependencies, batch size constraints, and session management. Careful handling of model bugs and configuration errors, along with persistent debugging efforts, ensured the stability of the training process. Ultimately, our iterative process resulted in more robust and accurate translation models. These models contribute to bridging linguistic gaps, promoting accessibility to Santali, and supporting the preservation of low-resource languages.
