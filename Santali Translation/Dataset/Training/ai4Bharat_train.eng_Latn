The Aihole inscription credits Pulakeshin with subjugating the Gangas of Talakad, who had matrimonial ties with the Kadambas.
Therefore, it appears that the Aihole inscription simply refers to Pulakeshin reaffirming the Chalukya suzerainty over the Alupas.
However, according to the Chalukya inscriptions, the Alupas had already been subjugated by Pulakeshin's predecessors.

Sambhaji is used to have used many innovations during his campaigns, one such innovation was when he made jackets from leather for his soldiers to ensure protection from lethal arrows fired by the Mysore army during his campaign against Mysore, it was highly successful as after the initial defeat of the Maratha army due to the poisonous arrows, the Maratha army was able to negate the arrows and achieved victory by using these leather jackets.
The government of Sambhaji gave promises of safety to the Marathas who gained independence from the Mughals and asked them to carry out their previous work of cultivation in their territories.
Shankar Narayan Joshi has stated that his approach to famine was very constructive and he provided solutions to many complicated problems.
Maratha accounts instead state that he was ordered to bow before Aurangzeb and convert to Islam and it was his refusal to do so, by saying that he would accept Islam on the day the emperor presented him his daughter's hand, that led to his death.

Sen also wrote an article for the New York Times documenting the reasons why India trails behind China in economic development.
He was outspoken about Narendra Modi's leadership in India.
In August 2019, during the clampdown and curfew in Kashmir for more than two weeks after the Indian revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status, Sen criticized the government and said "As an Indian, I am not proud of the fact that India, after having done so much to achieve a democratic norm in the world where India was the first non-Western country to go for democracy that we lose that reputation on the grounds of action that have been taken".

During this time Sen was also a frequent visitor to various other premiere Indian economic schools and centres of excellence like Jawaharlal Nehru University, Indian Statistical Institute, Centre for Development Studies, Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics and Centre for Studies in Social Sciences.
From 1957 to 1963, Sen served as a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.
As an alternative to Rawls's veil of ignorance, Sen chose the thought experiment of an impartial spectator as the basis of his theory of justice.
Kumar's relationship with actress Madhubala was the subject of much media attention.
Sen devised methods of measuring poverty that yielded useful information for improving economic conditions for the poor.
He elaborates upon this by illustrating the closely interconnected natures of the five main freedoms as he believes that expansion of one of those freedoms can lead to expansion in another one as well.
Social opportunities deal with the establishments that provide benefits like healthcare or education for the populace, allowing individuals to live better lives.
Any focus on income and wealth in the country would serve to increase the economic facilities for the people.
Political freedoms refer to the ability of the people to have a voice in government and to be able to scrutinize the authorities.
Kader Mia need not have come to a hostile area in search of income in those troubled times if his family could have managed without it.
Because of his extreme poverty, he had come to Sen's primarily Hindu neighbourhood searching for work; his choices were the starvation of his family or the risk of death in coming to the neighbourhood.

In the Bengal famine, rural laborers' negative freedom to buy food was not affected.
Sen points to a number of social and economic factors, such as declining wages, unemployment, rising food prices, and poor food-distribution, which led to starvation.
This staggering loss of life was unnecessary, Sen later concluded.
Sen's papers in the late 1960s and early 1970s helped develop the theory of social choice, which first came to prominence in the work by the American economist Kenneth Arrow.
Later, he gave his thoughts on his matches against Khalifman and Shirov:

In other words, workers were expected to demand no improvement in their standard of living despite having become more productive.
In a developing country, the Dobb-Sen strategy relied on maximising investible surpluses, maintaining constant real wages and using the entire increase in labour productivity, due to technological change, to raise the rate of accumulation.
While at Presidency, Sen was diagnosed with oral cancer, and given a 15% chance of living for five years.

He felt that his foremost responsibility was to improve the morale of his demoralised soldiers, which he achieved by ordering them to operate more aggressively.
The Indian Army suffered a debacle in the war, for which Kaul and Menon were held primarily responsible, and both were sacked.
It was widely believed that Manekshaw had come close to being dismissed from the service.
Meanwhile, two of his juniors, Harbaksh Singh and Moti Sagar, were promoted to lieutenant general and appointed as corps commanders.

The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang attests that Pulakeshin ruled an extensive, militarily powerful and economically prosperous kingdom through several loyal vassals.
Pulakeshin had multiple sons, and the order of succession after him is not clear from the available historical evidence.
The elephants, which were intoxicated with wine before battles, were used to break the enemy's front line.
According to Xuanzang, the king was war-like and loved "military arts", because he was a Kshatriya by birth.
The Vishnukundina ruler defeated by Pulakeshin was probably Indravarman: he appears to have ultimately accepted Pulakeshin's suzerainty, and was allowed to rule as a Chalukya vassal.
These scholars note that the Bijapur-Mumbai grant inscription, dated to 4 April 619 CE, mentions Pulakeshin's victory over Harsha, which proves that the conflict definitely took place sometime before this date.
The inscriptions of Pulakeshin's successors prominently mention this victory even when they ignore his other military achievements.

The Mahakuta pillar inscription of his predecessor Mangalesha states his father Kirtivarman also subjugated the Gangas.

However, these inscriptions also wrongly claim that Mangalesha returned the kingdom to Pulakeshin when Pulakeshin grew up, praising the Chalukya lineage for such exemplary behaviour.

The infection, known as Zika fever or Zika virus disease, often causes no or only mild symptoms, similar to a very mild form of dengue fever.
One of the structural proteins encapsulates the virus.
Before the current pandemic began in 2007, Zika "rarely caused recognized 'spillover' infections in humans, even in highly enzootic areas".
The virus replicates in the human testis, where it infects several cell types, including testicular macrophages, peritubular cells and germ cells, the spermatozoa precursors.
Semen parameters can be altered in patients for several weeks post-symptoms onset, and spermatozoa can be infectious.
In 2019, an improved diagnostic test, based on research from Washington University in St. Louis, that detects Zika infection in serum was granted market authorization by the FDA.
As of March 2016, 18 companies and institutions were developing vaccines against Zika, but they stated that a vaccine is unlikely to be widely available for about 10 years.
From then until 2007, there were only 13 further confirmed human cases of Zika infection from Africa and Southeast Asia.

Yaws is common in at least 13 tropical countries as of 2012. Almost 85% of infections occurred in three countries—Ghana, Papua New Guinea, and Solomon Islands.
Yaws may or may not have cardiovascular or neurological effects; definitive evidence is lacking.
It occurs in late stages of yaws, usually 5 to 10 years after first symptoms of infection.

A longitudinal study shows that 6 hours after cells are infected with Zika virus, the vacuoles and mitochondria in the cells begin to swell.
Once the cell has been infected, the virus restructures the endoplasmic reticulum, forming the large vacuoles, resulting in cell death.
By August 2016, more than 50 countries had experienced active transmission of Zika virus.
The true extent of the vectors is still unknown.
To detect the presence of the virus usually requires genetic material to be analysed in a lab using the technique RT-PCR.
The potential societal risk of Zika can be delimited by the distribution of the mosquito species that transmit it.
Zika virus appears to be contagious via mosquitoes for around a week after infection.
Zika virus can spread by vertical (or "mother-to-child") transmission, during pregnancy or at delivery.
Congenital brain abnormalities other than microcephaly have also been reported after a Zika outbreak.
Infection during pregnancy causes microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies.
Prevention involves decreasing mosquito bites in areas where the disease occurs, and proper use of condoms.
Oceania countries experiencing Zika today are New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Marshall Islands, American Samoa, Samoa, and Tonga.
The outbreak began in April 2015 in Brazil, and spread to other countries in South America, Central America, North America, and the Caribbean.

If your partner regularly asks to borrow money, you should inquire as to why they constantly need money.
They may have lost their job or have unpaid debts you don’t know about.
Always put both your names on the lease, mortgage, or loan.
Typical material assets include houses, cars, and boats.
These items should never be purchased using both your names.
If you have one steady job, then you may already have a decent idea of your income.
Compare prices before you commit to buying an item.
Make a list of every source of income you have.
Everyone has variable expenses that arise every month.
Think about the things that you don't really need, but like to treat yourself on.
Try using cash for your shopping trips instead of a debit/credit card.
Fan out the bills so that they form a circle.
Check for coupons, mail-in rebates, and other discounts at both your usual stores and at their competitors.
Think of it as paying back yourself for all your hard work each week.
Still others may want to buy a motor home after retiring and travel the country.
Decide what you want to save for, and set up a savings account.
If the wealth-building is your goal, you'll want to invest in securities like stocks or mutual funds.
Find coupons in your local newspaper or in the circular at the grocery store.
Depending on your savings goals, you may be saving up for retirement, your child's education, or other future purchases or expenses.
You're probably wondering how much money you'll need to remain financially stable.
If you're planning for retirement, for example, you may want to:
Talk to your employer about any available 401(k) plans.
This is a lower-tech option, but it is convenient.
Use popular apps such as Checkout 51, Grocery IQ, and Coupons.com.
The 50-20-30 rule probably won’t work for many people.
For example, your fixed expenses like rent might eat up more than 50% of your budget.
If you have debts, then you might need to spend more than 20% to pay them down.
Nevertheless, the 50-20-30 rule can help you identify where you are falling short.
You might not remember all of your debts, so you should go through your credit report to make sure you haven’t forgotten anything.
Provide your name, date of birth, address, and Social Security Number.
Depending on your situation, you might be able to lower the overall amount you pay on your debts.
Although this might not lower your monthly payments, you will ultimately save money in the long term.
Call up your credit card companies and ask for a better interest rate.
This will lower your monthly payment and your overall debt.
You can lower your monthly debt payments in the following ways.
For example, you might refinance a car loan and stretch out the repayment period to six years.
If you have student loans, you can ask for deferment or forbearance.
These balloons will be big enough so that the cash doesn't weigh them down.
Debt consolidation can also reduce your monthly payments, depending on the interest rate and repayment period.
Ideally, you should save 15-25% of your monthly paycheck.
This means that if you bring home $2,000 a month, you should save between $300 and $500.
That might not be a realistic goal right now, depending on your expenses.
If you can’t save 15%, then work on ways to reduce your discretionary spending.
Every little bit helps, and there are many ways to save every day.
Remember to buy groceries in bulk for extra savings.
Clipping coupons will help reduce the amount you spend each week.
You can also put confetti in the balloons.
You might also weatherize and insulate your home for increased savings.
An energy audit can reduce your energy expenses by 5-30%.
You can lower your auto or homeowners insurance by shopping around using an online aggregator.
Reduce the temptation to spend by freezing your cards in ice and carrying only cash on you.
Start small, by putting aside whatever extra money you can spare.
Don’t let debt repayment get in the way.
Most financial experts recommend that you build up at least a small emergency fund at first—say, three months.
Then you can tackle your credit card debt.
You might be surprised that your employer offers a retirement plan.
Also, check whether or not they will match any of your contributions.
For example, some employers might match up to 4% of your base salary.
This means you contribute 4% and they contribute 4%.
If you only contribute 3%, then they will match that.
You have plenty of options to choose from.
Start by figuring out exactly how much you make.
Everyone needs a little extra for everyday fun things and needs.
However, you have to make sure you're not spending more than you should.
Setting a weekly allowance of how much you can spend can help.
Go into an allowance with the understanding that when it's gone, it's gone.
Skipping impulse buying is also important at other stores, as well.
When possible, repair items when they break down instead of buying something new.
Check with your state to make sure the daycare you choose is licensed.
Your daycare may be one of them, which can help you save money.
Ask what the sibling discount is the next time you take your child in.
While the sibling discount may not be a whole lot, every little bit can help.
However, you do need to consider where your child will go after school.
Hiring a nanny for two children can be expensive.
However, if you share costs with another family or even two families, you can cut down on costs significantly.
You also must have earned income in the previous year, though you can also qualify if you are a student or disabled.
File your taxes with your partner if you're married.
However, you can only put a certain amount in, limited by the federal government.
You also must keep up with your expenses, as you must submit records to get the money.
In addition, any money left in the account at the end of the year is lost.
That way, you would be available to cover childcare on Friday and Saturday, and your partner could cover Sunday and Monday.
In turn, you would only need to pay for daycare 3 days a week.
Another option is one of you working nights, while the other works days, so someone is always there.
You could also work part time to help save money on childcare.
You can get childcare assistance from the government if you are low-income.
Find your state or territory to find the contact in your state.
Once you find your state, you will need to make sure you are eligible for assistance.
Generally, your eligibility is determined by your income.
For a family of four, if you have a spouse, the poverty level is $24,300.
Most of the time, you'll be able to apply online.
This number is in place to help people find the public assistance they need.
Nonetheless, in some states, childcare is not managed through this line, though they will probably be able to redirect you to the correct line.
You can also go to 211.org on the internet.
Ask them why they don’t go to a bank and get a personal loan.
However, many lenders will give personal loans to people with bad credit.
You can also assess how likely they are to repay the loan.
How much do they make in a week?
What other debts do they have to pay?
Don’t simply agree to lend whatever someone asks for.
For example, they might want to buy a computer but ask for $3,000.
You should definitely follow up and ask what computer they want.
A good rule of thumb: don’t lend more than you can afford to lose.
Depending on the circumstances, you might have the borrower pay you back every week.
You might want to charge interest, even if you are lending to friends or family.
Your jurisdiction probably has a maximum interest rate you can charge.
You can find the current rate on the IRS website.
If you lend someone $500, they should be able to pay you back in a few months.
However, if you lend someone $5,000, they might need a few years to pay back the loan.
The longer the repayment period, the less a person will have to pay every month.
However, they’ll pay more over the length of the loan if you charge interest.
Ideally, the borrower will pay an equal amount each month.
For example, the borrower might get paid every week and the amount borrowed might be small.
You want to prod the borrower to pay back the loan in a timely manner, so you should think about charging a fee if they miss a payment.
For example, you might charge $25 if they are 60 days late with the monthly payment.
A secured loan is safer than an unsecured one.
Getting security makes the loan process a little more complicated.
There are sample promissory notes online or in legal books.
Use one as a guide when drafting your own.
At the top of the document, you should include the title "Promissory Note" and then the following information in the first paragraph.
The borrower must explicitly promise to repay the loan.
If this language is missing, you don’t have a legal contract.
State how often payment will be made—monthly, weekly, etc.
Also identify the interest rate and whether the borrower can prepay the loan without penalty.
You might want to charge a penalty for late payment, or you could increase the interest rate.
You also might want to accelerate the loan.
For example, if the borrower misses a payment, you can immediately demand that they pay the entire loan.
If the borrower is pledging collateral, you’ll need to include a security agreement.
Search online and in legal books for a sample security agreement.
Both you and the borrower should sign the promissory note in front of a notary public.
Don’t give the borrower the money until they sign the promissory note.
Keep careful records of every payment made and the date received.
Detailed records will keep any disagreements from breaking out.
You should probably send the borrower confirmation when you receive payment.
The borrower might have simply forgotten to pay you.
Whatever the reason, you need to call them and find out.
Send past-due notices at the 30, 60, and 90-day marks.
This may seem like a hassle, but you need to document everything to protect yourself.
At 30 days, you simply remind the person that they are late with their payment.
At 90 days, tell them you are considering bringing a lawsuit.
Remember to send all notices by certified mail, and return receipt requested.
Hold onto the receipt and a copy of the letter.
Consult with an attorney about bringing the lawsuit.
They can help you identify your best course of action.
For example, in Florida, you get five years to sue.
If you're struggling to meet your own financial needs, give less.
For example, if your monthly expenses leave you with a small amount of extra spending money, you may want to give less.
If they are an acquaintance, coworker, or classmate, then the expectations for your gift are lower and you don't have to give as much.
Determine how close you are to the person and choose an amount of money that you feel is appropriate.
Different occasions call for different amounts of money.
Give more money for unique or special occasions that don't happen often.
Sometimes people can fall on hard times and money is one of the best gifts that you can give them.
It helps them catch up on bills and get essential things for themselves and their family.
Putting cash inside of a card or envelope is the most traditional way to give someone money.
A card allows you to write them a meaningful message while an envelope can help you personalize the message.
Think of creative ways that you can decorate your envelope to make the gift more special and unique.
Your envelope can say something like "Happy Birthday" or "Congratulations!"
If you're scared that the person might lose the money, you can always write out a personal check.
Remove all the chocolates from the box and replace them with folded up bills or a gift card.
Then, tape a sticky note or piece of card stock to the top of a cash, gift card, or check.
When they pull the note, they will also receive the gift of money.
You can use different folding techniques to create a variety of different animals and shapes.
You can fold bills into a money tree, rose, or ring just to name a few.
Find different ways to fold up your dollar bills or checks by searching on wikiHow.
You need to have a clear-cut plan for the future if you want to become financially independent.
Where do you want to be in 10 years?
How can you go about investing and saving your money to make sure you can achieve these goals?
For example, you can strive to have a job that pays well and has benefits.
When it comes to saving, you should start right now.
Getting into the habit of saving money can really help your long-term financial prospects.
You can do this either on a weekly or monthly basis.
If you have online banking, you can put away a certain amount of each paycheck in savings.
Many people struggle to set aside money and feel tempted to spend everything they have.
Use the information you learned in part one to do this.
For example, maybe you can put your family's cars under a single insurance policy instead of paying for three separate policies.
You may have to make some sacrifices, like skipping the family vacation this year, but it'll be worth it to live debt free.
Make sure to pay your credit card in full each month.
Mark when the bill is due on your calendar.
Figure out where you could stand to cut back.
A retirement fund is vital to ensure a stable financial future.
Take advantage of any program your employer offers, such as a 401K, and start putting money away as soon as possible.
You should also talk to a financial planner at your local bank.
You can look into starting something like a Roth IRA to save for retirement.
Look ahead to expenses that may come up down the line, such as sending your children to college or paying for an unexpected, major medical expense.
Planning and saving for these events far in advance can help keep you out of debt and retain your financial freedom.
Exchange-traded funds, bonds, bond funds, or mutual funds are all solid options for investing your excess funds.
You should also talk to your kids about managing money.
Tell them how to budget and spend wisely.
The type of advisor that you need depends on the complexity of your needs.
A Certified Financial Planner (CFP) must have a significant amount of experience and pass numerous exams to earn the CFP title.
This person will be trained in financial planning, taxes, insurance, employee benefits, estate planning and retirement.
CFPs® are also required to maintain their certification with continuing education, meaning their information will be up to date.
A CFP is comparable to a master's degree in financial planning.
A Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) works with high-net-worth investors (usually someone with a net worth over one million dollars).
Your RIA will look at your long-term goals and offer advice while managing your portfolio.
They charge a fee of about 1% of your invested assets per year, sometimes less.
A Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) specializes in life insurance and estate planning.
A CFP who wishes to set herself apart in these areas will earn a CLU designation, which requires additional education and the successful passing of eight exams.
A Chartered Financial Consultant® (ChFC®) requires the same education as someone with a CFP®, but there is no board exam.
This is just what it sounds like - instead of working with another human, an automated algorithm is used to help you manage your portfolio.
You cannot use this service for estate planning or taxes.
Someone who goes by the title investment counselor, wealth manager, or investment advisor should not automatically be considered the same as a CFP® or RIA.
Without those designations, they do not have the combined education, experience, and certifications of these other professionals.
A fee-only, independent advisor might be more expensive, especially if you are managing a very large amount of money.
That way, you can put a little more stock in their recommendation.
It's the other 30% that you are looking for.
Look for someone with at least a college degree, preferably in finance, economics, or business-related field.
Look for fee-only certified financial planners through the Financial Planning Association or the National Association of Financial Advisors.
The following are industry-specific documents you should request:
Put the extra income into your emergency fund each month.
It's important for your emergency money to be kept separate from your normal checking account so that you are not tempted to spend it.
Things like estate planning or managing stock options for a company may require in-person advising.
Also, "Related Changes" does not list recent changes to pages linked from the editable part of the category page as it would normally, with a non-category page.
The interest is compounded annually, or one time per year.
Mullets and catfish are the major brackish water fish, which have supported sustenance fishing for the lagoon fishermen.
The lagoon is a nursery for several species of fish.
In the Andhra Pradesh part of the lagoon, several threats to the lagoon have been identified.
Ichamati River is a trans-boundary river which flows through India and Bangladesh and also forms the boundary between the two countries.
The area is similar to the dikes of the Netherlands, where land has been reclaimed from the sea and crops are grown.
Celebrate any achievements, like a reached milestone or the completion of a short-term goal.
You might also need to go online to check the number.
This can help you stay motivated to complete your longer term goals.
Schools in Telangana are run by the state government or private organisations, which include religious institutions.

Tripur was the 39th descendant of Druhyu, who belonged to the lineage of Yayati, a king of the Lunar Dynasty.
This can be from a real client she has advised or a basic approach she might take to your own account.
And if you have a large portfolio, you should be able to negotiate fees to 0.5% or less.
That could mean the difference between being able to retire versus having to continue working.
This is a legal concept known as "fiduciary," and while some advisors are legally considered fiduciaries, some are not.
A fiduciary advisor knows that he cannot act outside your best interest without risking a lawsuit.
Sometimes, after all the interview questions are finished, you have to simply ask yourself how you feel about this person.
You need to feel comfortable with her communication style and personality.
One purpose of a financial advisor is to help you set and achieve your financial goals.
If you follow your advisor's advice and still do not meet your financial goals over time, find someone else.
While it is true that it is your money, a good advisor must act in your best interest, not kowtow to your every whim.
She should decline to make any investment that she thinks is unwise, even if you want to make it.
Not all compound interest-bearing accounts are created equal.
Check online for information about interest rates at different places.
In addition, call banks, credit unions, and investment firms to understand how they can help you.
Do not settle when it comes to growing your money using compound interest.
All you have to do is input the numbers, and it will do the rest.
Think about your financial objectives and what type of investor you are.
Banks fight for your business just like any other industry.

Additionally, a lot of good rates are offered to young people to help them save early.
Compound interest is most effective when your money is in an account for a long period of time.
If your income varies week to week, average your earnings after taxes over the course of the last year.
When you start saving late in life, you do not have the ability to leave your money in the account for a long time.
Start setting money in an account when you are 18.
This will help you create more money over a shorter period of time and maximize the benefits of compound interest.
The more money you have in your account, the more money you can make in interest.
This number will be told to you when you open the account.
Just multiply your regular paycheck after taxes by 26 if you get paid biweekly or by 52 if you get paid weekly.
Third, you need to find out how many times the interest is compounded each year.
However, in some circumstances, interest can compound quarterly, or even monthly.
Finally, you need to decide how long you want to keep the money in the account.
Once you know the values of all of your variables, you can make the calculation.
Next, assume you plan on keeping the money in the account for 30 years.
If you want to make a more conservative estimate, use your lowest monthly income during the last year to set your budget.
You should spend no more than 20 to 30 percent of your income on rent or mortgage.
Plan on spending at least another 20 per cent on utilities, like electricity, water, heating, and cooling.

Keep track of milestones as you go along.
Cooking one large meal and freezing portions will cut down on the amount of time your stove is in use and help you cut your electricity or gas bills.
You should treat a loan as business interaction, not as something personal.
Try to separate the loan from your personal relationship with your lender.
In order to write a financial plan, you'll first have to have a clear picture of where your finances are now.
The difference (assets - liabilities) is your net worth.
Be clear about why you are implementing a financial plan and what you hope to accomplish with it.
Look at your goals and try to assign an estimated cost to each one.
This will help you plan your monthly savings amounts.
Investment accounts can be useful for retirement savings, college funds, and other long-term goals.
This type of account is not recommended for short or medium term goals.
For more, see how to invest in stocks.
For example, take note when your investment account reaches half or a quarter of your goal value.
Come up with several ways to do this.
For example, you could look through your budget and see if there are areas where you can cut your expenses.
Alternately, you can take on a second job or otherwise increase your income.
You can also consider moving your savings directly to an investment account.
This might introduce more risk but gives you the chance to earn more interest.
Identify several specific strategies that can be used to reach your goals and compare them to each other.
Look at the pros and cons of each option and decide for yourself which course of action to take.

If you find yourself engaging in mental self-criticism, stop and focus on positive decisions that you’ve made instead.
If you catch yourself engaging in excessive mental self-criticism, stop and divert your thoughts to something else.
Obsessing over regrets will leave you looking to the past and the mistakes that it contains.
Rather than doing this, focus on the future and ways in which you can overcome the financial situation you find yourself in.
Most credit card websites allow you to set up monthly automated payments, as do websites for utilities and services like electricity and internet service.
For example, imagine you splurged at dinner and spend $100 on the meal when you only meant to spend $40.
Since you’re now $60 in the red, you’ll need to save $60 on other expenditures.
To help leave your savings account intact, view it as money for emergencies or for unexpected expenses; don’t think of savings as a large reservoir of spending money.
A large source of financial regret for individuals later in their lives comes from the fact that they did not plan ahead or save enough for retirement.
Enter the annual interest rate, for example, 2 percent.
Add the payment period to the calculation, in years.
In this example, the annual payment would be about $61,000, or about $5,000 per month.
From that point, you can deduce your periodic payments.
Enter either the present value, the PV key, the future value, or the FV key, or both.
Future value is the value of an asset or amount of money at a specified date in the future.
This calculation relies on an interest rate that will be earned by the money or asset over those years.
In many instances, n is a number of years.
Start by inputting all of your variables into the future value equation.
The present value equation is very similar to the future value equation, except the exponent for the number of years is negative.
These calculations make it clear that time is literally money.
The value of the money you have now is higher than the same amount of money in the future.
This is why you should know how to calculate the time value of money.
Your money manager advises you that you can safely earn ten per cent interest per year if you invest the money.
The present value of the $1 million is, obviously, $1 million.
This is only two-fifths of the monetary value of the later payment, though.
Interest on an investment is usually expressed as a percentage.
Interest can be compounded annually, monthly or quarterly.
Divide 72 by the annual interest rate your investment is earning.
The answer will tell you how many years it will take for your investment to double in value.
Interest rates on investments do fluctuate, so the rule of 72 should be used as a tool for estimating the future value of your investments.
This calculator is provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission's website Investor.gov.
This lets the calculator know that you owe the money instead of owning it.
If your result is negative, you will still owe money at the end of the timeframe.
Say, for example, you owe $20,000 on a credit card that charges 20% interest compounded monthly.
Suppose you deposited $1,500 into a bank account.
Suppose you want to find out how much compound interest you will have earned after six years.
Compound interest is calculated on loans using the same formulas.
However, instead of earning you a lot of money, compound interest on loans can cost you a lot of money.
High interest rate credit cards, for example, often compound interest monthly.
This means that if you are carrying a balance, the amount you have to pay back grows exponentially every month.
The interest rate is 20 percent compounded annually.
But the value of engaging in work that is mentally and spiritually rewarding goes beyond any kind of monetary value.
For instance, if you are a lawyer, you might make a great deal of money.
A job that provides meaning, enjoyment, and purpose is superior to a job that only provides a paycheck.

You might reflect on the millions around the globe who are homeless.
Write down a list of everything that was paid for with a loan.
In the case of credit card debt, that expense can be quite high.
However, just because something is interest-free it does not make it good debt.
That increase in value will offset, to some degree, the interest that you're paying for the mortgage.
If you still have college loans, you invested in your professional career.
You need to examine the cost of good debt versus the expected return on investment.
If you have to, liquidate some of your investments to purchase items that go down in value.

Cashing out of an annuity can be expensive depending on when you are doing it.
If you can find another way to get the money you need, you might want to consider leaving your annuity alone.
Before you pull out cash from an annuity, consider how much you will need.
Once you have calculated the surrender charges and decided to cancel the annuity contract, you will need to pay the charge to the insurance company.
Figuring this out will help you determine whether you will need to make a partial withdrawal or a full surrender.
When everything is complete, your insurance company will send you the money in your annuity, minus any fees they charge you.
When you receive your payment, try not to spend it all.
Remember that some of that money will be taxed according to various Internal Revenue Service or IRS and state rules and regulations.
For example, assume you have an immediate annuity with a current value of $10,000.
You would not owe the insurance company any surrender charge.
When you arrive, chances are you won't be the first person there.
This tax applies to anything you must include as gross income.
List each housing or debt expense, and add them up.
That is, if your monthly income is $5,000, your housing and debt payments should pay for no more than $1500.

For example, 25% expressed as a decimal is .25.
For example, you might know that a sweater is $69 and on sale for 25% off.
Make sure you use the decimal form of the percent.
So, $17.25 is the discount on the original price.
In order to calculate the discount percent of an item, you need to know what the sale price is, and what the original or list price is.
For example, you might know that a sweater’s original price is $69, and that it is on sale for $51.75.
This will give you the markdown amount, the number of dollars taken off the original price.
This will give you the percent of the discount as a decimal.
To convert to a percent, move the decimal point two places to the right.

Cloth grocery bags are a useful touch if you want the best shopping experience.
When you're buying food items, it's a smart idea to make a habit of checking the expiry date.

You should leave room on your shopping list for improvisation.
In-store specials are worth exploiting if it's something you would have wanted anyway.
You can look it up online or ask a sales associate what it will be.
While states usually set a statewide sales tax, some municipalities add their own taxes on top of that.
Check online to see what is, and is not, taxed in your area.
Take the percent number and imagine a decimal point after it.
Now move that decimal point two spaces to the left, giving you the decimal equivalent of the sales tax percentage.
This will give you the total price you will have to pay at the register.
To use our example from the previous step one more time, $20 plus $2 makes the estimated total cost including tax $22.
Basically, wear bottoms that you can change out of easily.
Don't allow any other item to be placed on the scale, otherwise you'll end up paying for more than what the weight really was on the item.

A bazaar may be a great place to bargain, but an expensive shopping mall probably isn't.

You won't be enticed to splurge on an item because you'll be limited by how much cash you have.
Reaching out with a handful of cash and exclaiming "It's all the cash I have" is a good trick that often works.

Avoid getting snappy if you don’t like what they’re saying.
While being polite, you need to be assertive and confident.
You should articulate your dissatisfaction in a forceful way and communicate that you want the best service possible.
This is perhaps the most important part of the phone call.
In a very clear and concise way, explain the problem or your issue to the agent.
Don’t make assumptions about what they know or don’t know.
Ask them to restate your issue after you’re done explaining it.

Before you leave for the campout, don’t forget to wear warm and comfortable clothes.

Some companies will give you various price quotes.
If you're with someone, take car or bathroom breaks, do a snack or food run, and keep an eye on the time.
But remember that if you don’t have a buddy or if there is no bathroom close by, a bathroom break may not be easy.
Try to keep breaks to a minimum by watching your liquid intake.

However, you may only find a used "A-grade" container with double doors and air conditioning.
In this case, you’ll have to do the flooring yourself.
This is the easiest way to find a used shipping container for sale.
Look up keywords like, "Used shipping container near me," and browse units for sale.
If it’s more than a few miles away, it could cost a lot.
While this is not required, it can be really helpful when browsing lots of shipping containers.
Use a program such as Excel to keep track of the shipping containers you are interested in.
To check this, open the door completely and shut the door securely.
You want the door to completely seal without letting any air in.
If you have any problems doing this, the lining of the seal may be messed up and need repair.
Choose a shipping container with minimal rust if you can.
If you find substantial holes in the unit, you’ll have to patch them before you convert the container.
Once you’ve agreed upon price, pay with either cash or card, depending on the seller’s preference.

In this case, you would be ready to invest $9,750 plus commissions.
You would place an order with your broker to buy 500 shares of JCP at a limit of $19.50.
If the stock price drops to $19.50 per share or less and there is a seller, your broker would execute your order.
However, this order will go unfilled if the price drops below $25 before your shares can be sold.
This is the price at which your order will be filled.

When most people think of the food court at the mall, the word "local" might not spring to mind.

If you are purchasing a brand new container, which will likely be shipped from Asia, you should expect to spend significantly more, especially when it comes to delivery costs.

Remember though, that unloading, especially if you are having the delivery person place it in a specific way, will cost extra.
Make sure you negotiate this cost with the seller.
In countries such as the US, most dealers have many more containers than they need, so it is in their interest for you to purchase one.
If they won’t budge on the price, try asking for free delivery.
However, it’s still likely that many dealers will insist that you come into the dealership before they talk money.
Then, you and the dealer can negotiate back and forth and end up near $3,000.

Dealers may take that as a sign that they can charge more for the car.

Because of the compounding effect of interest, if you're able to, start putting money away for retirement when you're as young as 20.
The last way you can maximize the benefits of compound interest is to keep adding money to your account.
The variables in this equation can be defined as follows:
When you input your numbers, make sure they are represented in the correct form.
First, identify the principal, which is the amount you deposit or invest into the account.
If you do not have a calculator or device that can do the equation, there are websites out there that will do the math for you.
Create your budget based on realistic expectations so you'll be more likely to stick with it.
From setting a budget to finding a place of your own, accepting that your lifestyle must change is the most essential lesson to learn.

Your strategies can either focus on cutting expenses, earning more income, or a combination of the two.

You may also find that your chosen strategy is ineffective in helping you reach goals.

Present value calculations can also be used to analyze the profitability of business projects by using the concept "net present value."
The two main types of interest that can be applied to loans are simple and compound interest.
Simple interest is calculated by multiplying the interest by the principal by the number of periods.
Compound interest, however, is the most commonly used method of applying interest to a loan or investment.
The rate at which the interest accrues, or accumulates over time, depends on how often the interest is compounded.
An investment should be entered as a positive number while a loan amount should be entered as a negative number (using a "-" sign).
This can be an expected interest rate if you are unsure.

A variable deferred annuity, on the other hand, allows the principal to be invested more aggressively in a range of funds.
Each insurance company will do things differently so be sure to look around.
Investment management fees will depend on how aggressive you are investing.
If the payment is $50 each month, try to pay $100 or even $200 or more.
Surrender charges are fees associated with the early withdrawal of money from your annuity.
These are the fees you have to look at closest when you think you may have to cash out of an annuity down the road.
You surrender the annuity in your sixth year.
You will owe a 2% surrender charge to the insurance company.
Both involve refinancing your home and reducing payments.

If you have extra money at the end of each month, you can put it into the emergency fund as savings.
For example, you may have a substantial entertainment expense that could be cut down, or you may spend quite a bit on fashion, food, or a hobby.
Try cutting expenses by not eating out as frequently, going to the salon every eight weeks instead of every six, buying less clothing, or not buying new games.
For example, your cell phone service provider may offer you a lower rate if you call their customer service line and tell them you're considering switching service providers.
If you work as an hourly employee, consider working a couple extra hours every week, and putting that money directly into the emergency fund.
It also helps you to be able to keep track of exactly how much money is in your emergency account at all times.
You can start the account with any amount of money you have available, although many banking institutions will require a specific minimum amount, such as $100.
Put your excess money each month into the debt with the highest interest rate until the balance is completely paid off.
If you only have one major source of debt, then try to put as much extra money into each payment as you can each month.

A deferred annuity provides a way for you to accumulate funds on a tax-deferred basis.
Make sure you have your phone charged along with a solid cellular signal or connect to the store's Wi-Fi network (if possible).
One of the most important things to consider when purchasing an annuity is the charges you will incur.
Rider charges are optional services you can add to your annuity for a fee.
You surrender your annuity in your first year.
It should be the remaining portion of your budget.
In total, you would have to pay $15,000 just to cancel the annuity contract.
In another example, assume you have an immediate annuity with a current value of $30,000.
You surrender your annuity in your thirteenth year.
To determine your tax liability for making a nonperiodic payment, you will need to decide whether the distribution is being made before or after the annuity starting date.
Make sure to check to see if your information will be shared with a third party.
If the non-periodic payment is made after your annuity starting date, you will need to determine whether you are taking a partial withdrawal or completely surrendering the contract.
If you are completely surrendering the contract, the amount you receive in excess of your investment will be taxable.
For example, assume you have an annuity with a cash value of $100,000.
This amount is your total income, and as you create your budget, all of your expenses cannot exceed this amount or you will go into debt.
Remember that paychecks are after-tax, and so the tax must be added back in to obtain gross income.

Taxes should account for about 25% of your budget (if your income is $5000/month, your taxes should account for no more than $1250).
Your variable expenses are costs that come up in different amounts each month.
Variable expenses can include things like food, entertainment, clothing, pet care, the beauty salon, dry cleaners, or other places you spend your money.
For example, if you own a dog, you may typically spend $50 on dog food per month.
That makes pet care a "variable expense" for the purpose of your budget.
For example, a variable expense is buying food for the month, whereas a discretionary expense might be going out to eat.
Tracking your spending will help you identify whether you are staying within these guidelines, or if you need to identify places where you can make cuts in your spending.
If you spend more than your income each month, you'll go into debt.
Also, when you decide how much to include, you should take into account any dependents you might have and potential emergency needs they might have.
The money in an emergency fund must be liquid and therefore earns less than other investments with a longer term.
The excess over the emergency funds should be invested at a higher rate.
If your health or the health of your family members is poor, you might be more likely to have to fund an unexpected hospital stay.
But being good with money means knowing when to save and when to spend, and your emergency fund should be saved for true emergencies.
